        "[Cohort Analysis](https://medium.com/swlh/cohort-analysis-using-python-and-pandas-d2a60f4d0a4d) is specifically useful in analyzing user growth patterns for products. In terms of a product, a cohort can be a group of people with the same sign-up date, the same usage starts month/date, or the same traffic source.\n",
        "Cohort analysis is an analytics method by which these groups can be tracked over time for finding key insights. This analysis can further be used to do customer segmentation and track metrics like retention, churn, and lifetime value.\n",
        "\n",
        "For e-commerce organizations, cohort analysis is a unique opportunity to find out which clients are the most valuable to their business. by performing Cohort analysis you can get the following answers to the following questions:\n",

        "- How much effective was a marketing campaign held in a particular time period?\n",
        "- Did the strategy employ to improve the conversion rates of Customers worked?\n",
        "- Should I focus more on retention rather than acquiring new customers?\n",
        "- Are my customer nurturing strategies effective?\n",
        "- Which marketing channels bring me the best results?\n",
        "- Is there a seasonality pattern in Customer behavior?\n",
