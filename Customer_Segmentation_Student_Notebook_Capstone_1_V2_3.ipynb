The better you understand the customer, the better you serve them, and the higher the financial gain you receive from that customer. Since the dawn of trade, this process of understanding customers for a strategic gain has been there practiced and this task is known majorly as [Customer Segmentation](https://clevertap.com/blog/rfm-analysis/).\n",
        "Well as the name suggests, Customer Segmentation could segment customers according to their precise needs. Some of the common ways of segmenting customers are based on their Recency-Frequency-Monatory values, their demographics like gender, region, country, etc, and some of their business-crafted scores. You will use Recency-Frequency-Monatory values for this case.\n",
